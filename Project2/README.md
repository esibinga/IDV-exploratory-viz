Prospectus - Darts

This project is a beginner's guide to darts, or rather, "the darts." I've never particularly enjoyed watching sports or games on TV, so I was more than a little surprised to find myself deeply invested in the World Darts Championship at Alexandra Palace over Christmas break in 2017. I spent a week in front of the TV cheering for every oooooone-hundred-and-eighty and every next corpulent/ bowling-shirted/ bald(ing) athlete to step up to the oche for his throw. It is 100% on my lifetime bucket list to get tickets one year. 

As I've started to look at the data, I'm finding myself struck by the tight margins that separate really, really good darts players from "all time great" darts players. At the same time, the path high level darts players in general is not like the path for many great soccer, baseball, football, or tennis players (e.g. training camps and academies). Most of the darts players at the very top have their current or former employment listed, jobs like factory worker, joiner (carpenter), or postman. One player won the 2018 World Darts Championship 11 months after hanging up his electrician's belt to go pro (his nickname is Voltage). 

There's also a significant and self-aware side to darts that is completely ridiculous. Every single player has a nickname (The Flying Scotsman, Snake Bite, The Power, Chizzy, Duzza, Barney) and an entrance song (Eye of the Tiger, Seven Nation Army, The Power [as in, I've got the power], Jump Around). It was legal to drink pints on stage until 1989. 

I'd like to paint a visual picture of darts for people who aren't familiar with this rip-roaring piece of sport and TV. I'm compiling data on players from datsdatabase.co.uk, and will also include at least one visualization based on the dartboard itself (like a heatmap of the highest scoring sections).
