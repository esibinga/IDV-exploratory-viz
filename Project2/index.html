        Contrary to popular belief, the bullseye (more accurately, the double bullseye) isn't the "best" tile on the board. It's worth 50 points, and there are 4 tiles worth more: the triples of 17, 18, 19, and 20. 
        <br><br>
        Why does that matter? The goal of a game of darts is to score exactly 501 points. The first stage of a game of darts is to get as many points as possible. 
        <br> <br> Each tile in the inner ring is worth triple the value of that section, and the outer ring is worth double the value.

          Each player throws three darts per turn. <br> <br>
          Professional darts players (the only kind we care about on TV) are generally hoping for 180 points per turn: 
          three triple-20s in a row. <br> <br>
          Here's how many 180s have been thrown by 
          50 top darts players over the last 20 years.

            The shortest game of darts is over in 9 darts -- a 9-darter.

          There’s one more important thing: how does a game of darts end? <br> <br> <br>
          A game of darts can only end with a player reaching 501 points by hitting a <b>double</b> tile – one of the tiles around the outside of the board or the double bullseye in the center.  <br> <br>
          This chart highlights the most efficient checkouts, but in truth the possibilities are basically endless--particularly if you miss the spot you're aiming for!
